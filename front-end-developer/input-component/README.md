### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Material Design Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#what-are-material-icons-)

## User Storys

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

**Challenge**: Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- [x] User story: I can see error state
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable input
- [x] User story: I can choose to have helper text
- [x] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [x] User story: I can have different input sizes
- [x] User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- [x] User story: I can have multiline input like a textarea
- [x] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [x] User story: I can still access all input attributes
- [x] User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
