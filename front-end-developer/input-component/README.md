## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## User Storys

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

**Challenge**: Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- [ ] User story: I can see error state
- [ ] User story: I can choose to disable input
- [ ] User story: I can choose to have helper text
- [ ] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [ ] User story: I can have different input sizes
- [ ] User story: I can have different colors
- [ ] User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- [ ] User story: I can have multiline input like a textarea
- [ ] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [ ] User story: I can still access all input attributes
- [ ] User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
